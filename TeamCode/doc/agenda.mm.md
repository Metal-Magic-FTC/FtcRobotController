## Back to Basics

### Java

### Object Oriented

### Back to GitHub

- [ ] Revisit Our Github Process 
- [ ] Revisit the use of GitHub Issues (and Projects)
- [ ] Document as Code (Readme and other forms)

## Crawl

### A crawl around the FTC SDK

- [ ]  Learn how to use Objects available in SDK
- [ ]  [Integrate V1 of Roadrunner](https://learnroadrunner.com/)
- [ ]  

## Walk

- [ ] Diagram as Code
- [ ] Investigate FTC lib(https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/v/v2.0.0) not SDK, but a separate project

### Sensors

- [ ] Document use-cases of how ONE sensor can be used by itself

## Run

- [ ] advanced GitHub pages instead of websites using Jekyll
- [ ] Use multiple sensors (Sensor Fusion). Document potential use-cases
- [ ] What else?

## Building Robot

### Building Blocks

#### Driving Around

- [ ] Choose between Odometry or PID
- [ ] Determine current position on Field

#####  Go from Point A to B in the fastest possible time
- [ ] Implement some basic code
- [ ] Optimize to make it FAST (Go as fast as possible without over/undershooting)
