/**
 *  <b>FROM RAJESH JAIN:</b>
 * Temporarily class to hold different types of motion possible using 4 wheels.
 * There are multiple ways of making the wheels move AND around z-axis located
 * in different places. See {@see  <a href="https://www.vexforum.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bf03db89929d6677f152f112da8e2181e94d9156.jpeg">diagram</a>}
 * Eventually we would want to refactor and isolate our code in one place so that the various motions (like rotate,
 * moveForward, moveBackward, etc. FUTURE EXERCISE..NOT YET
